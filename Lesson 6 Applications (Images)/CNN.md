- A specific type of neural network used primarily for visual data, such as images and video.
- Provide a more scalable approach to image classification and object recognition tasks
    - Leveraging principles from linear algebra, i.e., specifically matrix multiplication to identify patterns within  an image.
- However, CNNs can be computationally demanding, requiring graphical processing units (GPUs) to train models
- CNNs are distinguished from orther neural networks by their superior performance with image, speech, or audio signal inputs.
