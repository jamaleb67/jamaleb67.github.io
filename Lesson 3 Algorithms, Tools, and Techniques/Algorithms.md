# Algorithms, Programming and other Tools
An **Algorithm** represents a rule or set of rules for solving a problem or performing a task. It can also be 
defined as a sequence of steps that transform an input into an output.
The input can be in the form of:

- Attributes (Fields or features) 
    - Features of an Instance
- Concepts
    - Results from a learning process
- Instance  
    - Occurence of a class or object.
As a result we focus on object-oriented programming (OOP)
- Data is organized in terms of **object and classes**, which contain fields (**attributes**), and are operated on by 
different functions (**methods**).

**Five Steps to Writing Algorithms**
1. Obtain Description of Problem
2. Analyze the Problem
3. Develop a High-level Algorithm
4. Refine the Algorithm by adding more detail
5. Review the Algorithm

**Asymptotic Notations**
- Asymptotic analysis is important because it is a measure of efficiency of Algorithms
- **Asymptotic notations** are used primarily to describe **algorithm runtime**.

**Asymptotic Bounds**
1. Theta
_Upper and lower bounds of functions
2. Big "O"
- Upper bound of a functions
3. Omega
- Lower bound of a function.

**Data Structures**
- Array
    - Structure of fixed size
    - Memory-efficient
    - Collection of homogeneous elements
    
- List
    - Structure of fixed size that contains element of different data types
    - Requires more memory
    - Collection of heterogeneous elements
    - Items accessed by Position

- Hashtable (Loosely typed)
    - Non-generic collection of key-value pairs of any data types
    - Maps keys to values by taking the hash value of the key and mapping it to bucket where one or more values stored.
    - Specific implementation of dictionary
    - No need to specify type of key and value.

- Dictionary (Tightly typed)
    - Generic collection that stores key-value pairs of specific data types 
    - Maps keys to values via the keys
    - Must specify key and value

- Tuple
    - Ordered, unchangeable collection
    - Sequences like lists, but cannot be changed
- Steps
    - Ordered, and indexed
    - No duplicates
- Trees
    - Data structure where data arranged hierarchically and linked together.
- Heaps
    - Binary trees in which parent nodes are compared to their children and values are arranged accordingly.
