I am driven to create positive impacts that help people. Ever since I first enlisted in the army, I have seen and experienced the pivotal impact leaders can have at every level of an organization, some phenomenal and some detrimental. Authentic leadership is a never-ending process that I am passionately engaged in developing in myself and those around me. I believe in the power of leadership to transform and improve the lives of others by empowering the people around you.

I am currently an IT Project Manager at Fort Belvoir. I am also pursuing a second bachelor's in business with a concentration in accounting at George Mason University and a graduate certificate in Data Science intelligence at the National Intelligence University.

Skills: VUE JS / REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / PYTHON
