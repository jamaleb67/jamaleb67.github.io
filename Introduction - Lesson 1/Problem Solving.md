# Think Like a Programmer
One of the major challenges to programming is the lack of problem solving skills, i.e., the 
ability to take a given problem description and write an original program to solve it.
What is often missing is the focus on the **Algorithm**, i.e., the rule or rules needed to solve
the problem. Not all programming requires extensive problem solving. Problem solving is hard because problem
solving is different from learning programming syntax and requires a different mental acumen.<br> Remember, that programming is a "_means to an end_", **not** _the end result_. It is just a **tool**, though a very important tool. Instead of learning
programming by **trial and error**, it is more helpful to use a **systematic approach**. In particular, there are simple strategies for problem solving, including:


- Always have a plan. 
- Restate the problem.
- Divide the problem into steps or phases.
- Start with what you know.
- Reduce the problem by either adding or subtracting constraints.
- Look for analogies.
- Experiment, i.e., try things (not the same as guessing).
