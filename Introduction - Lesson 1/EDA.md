# Exploratory Data Analysis

The **first step** in any data science project: **Exploring the Data**.

In 1962, John Tukey, an eminent Statistician and Mathematician, proposed that inference, a sometimes complex set of procedures used to draw conclusisions about large populations based on small samples should be expanded via a new discipline,**data analysis**, in which statistical inference was but one component.Tukey originally developed in the 1970s, EDA techniques that continue to be a widely used method in the data discovery process today.
 
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is used by data scientists to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics, often employing data visualization methods. It helps determine **how best to manipulate data sources to get the answers you need**, **making it easier** for data scientists** to discover patterns**, **spot anomalies**, **test a hypothesis**, or **check assumptions**.

EDA is primarily used to see what data can reveal beyond the formal modeling or hypothesis testing task and provides a provides a better understanding of data set variables and the relationships between them. It can also help determine if the statistical techniques you are considering for data analysis are appropriate.

**Data cleaning is based on three (3) fundamental aspects**, i.e.:
- Missing Values: Drop Missing Values vs Replace Missing Values
- Outliers: Use Z-score vs Quantiles
- Duplicate Values: In Python, use .duplicated() method.

# Types of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
   - [ ] Univariate Analysis.
       The simplest form of EDA, which entails analyzing a single data point relative to dimensional variables for insights. 
       The main purpose of the univariate analysis is to describe the data and find patterns that exist within it.
       Examples of data visualization designs to use in this analysis are Simple Bar, Pie, Radial etc. 
   - [ ] Multivariate Analysis.
         Entails analyzing multiple variables for insights. The best charts to use for this analysis include Scatter Plot, Radar Chart, and a Double Axis Line and Bar Chart.
