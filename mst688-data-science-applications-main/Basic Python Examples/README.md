Welcome to Python-in-2-days.  Here you will learn about Interactive Python (Jupyter Notebooks), linear algebra with NumPy, dataframes with Pandas, rich and interactive plotting tools with MatPlotLib and Seaborn, exploratory data analysis, machine learning model validation, and scientific computing with SciPy. From there you can extend these tools to other datasets and applications in machine learning.
