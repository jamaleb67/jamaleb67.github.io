This course (not just this notebook) was built using material from my private industry and acedemic experience, as well as material borrowed from:
- UCLA ECE 239AS
- UPenn CIS 229
- UPenn CIS 520
- Stanford CS 229
- Python Data Science Handbook
- Machine Learning Mastery
- Towards Data Science
- Randy Olson's data analysis and machine learning projects.
- Many thanks to [Andreas Mueller](http://amueller.github.io/) for some of his [examples](https://github.com/amueller/scipy_2015_sklearn_tutorial) in the Machine Learning section. I drew inspiration from several of his excellent examples.
- Many thanks to Kaggle for the datasets
- Numerous others that I cannot remember.
