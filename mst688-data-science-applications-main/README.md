# MST-688 Data Science Applications

## Course Description
This course explores data science history, evolution, application, and philosophical underpinnings within the realm of intelligence. Students should be able to integrate their knowledge of intelligence and how to achieve better decision making, respond to key intelligence matters, and make recommendations based on using data science. The goal is to integrate knowledge within the data science discipline, achieving and advancing to a higher level of understanding on IC situations. Students will be able to synthesize the techniques, resources, and capabilities associated with the applications of data science within intelligence. 

## Course Format
Each class is divided into two sections. Lecture and labs. The lectures will cover data science topics so students can understand the history and entire workflow of data from collection through processing. The labs consist of coding templates, which explore some aspect of coding. Associated with the labs are the homeworks for that week.

Lecture material is on blackboard.  Labs and homework assignments are contained in this repository for both the 10 session (weekday) and 8 session (weekend/monthly executive program) versions of the course.
