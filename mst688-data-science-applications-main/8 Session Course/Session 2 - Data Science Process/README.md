# Lab 2a - Explore High Side Data Sets

1. Log into SageMaker on high side.
2. Clone 688 course repo from GitLab.
3. Walk through example using FADE API.
4. Explore data available through this API or other APIs available on high side network.
5. This is just an example exercise and does not need to be turned in.


# Homework 2a - Figuring out your Question

This homework is the first step in creating your final project.  Choose a question related to a topic you want to know more about.  This can be from your work, another course you are taking, your thesis research, or just a personal curiosity.  The question/project can involve classified or unclassified data, however, only do a classified project if you have access to work on it between class sessions.

1. Create a directory in your git repository called Project-Lastname
2. Create a README.md file in your project directory that includes:
 - Initial question
 - Intended type of analysis (e.g. inferential, mechanistic)
 - Describe initial analysis plan
3. Create a jupyter notebook with code of an initial exploration  (question-data symbiotic relationship)
4. Use git to add, commit (include HW2a in commit message), and push your homework to turn it in

#### Rubric:
Did the student create an initial question? (5 points)
Did the student describe the intended type of analysis? (5 points)
Did the student describe their initial analysis plan? (5 points)
Did the student create code to conduct initial exploration? (5 points)



# Lab 2b - Playing with Pandas

1. Open the Lab 2 - Playing with Pandas Jupyter Notebook.
2. Walk through the examples of how to create, use, and modify Pandas DataFrames.
3. For more information, go to go to /mst688-data-science-applications/Basic Python Examples/D1_L5_Pandas/.
4. This is just an example exercise and does not need to be turned in.


# Homework 2b - Tidy the Data

Continue working with the data for your project.  Make your dataset clean and tidy.  

1. Use the Jupyter notebook created in your Project-Lastname directory for Homework 2a
 - Organize your data into data stuctures (doesn't have to be dataframes, but describe the data structure used and why)
 - Check data for missing/null values, errors, and inconsistencies.  Correct and describe the correction being made (e.g. setting null values to zero, converting state names to abreviations using lookup table, removing commas from numbers to prevent parsing errors, etc.).  If no errors are found, describe how the data was checked for errors.
2. Update your analysis plan in the README.md to include how you are organizing your data
3. Use git to add, commit (include HW2b in commit message), and push your homework to turn it in

#### Rubric:
Does the student have clearly understood/documented data structures? (6 points)
Has the student checked the data by cleaning out missing values and (if applicable) identified data errors? (6 points)
Does the student have well documented code taking the user from data source to output? (6 points)
Did the student update their README.md to reflect new knowledge gained through tidying and checking data (if no change, add line that says no change and HW4/date)? (2 points)
