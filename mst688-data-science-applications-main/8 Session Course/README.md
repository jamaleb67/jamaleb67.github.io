## Session 1a - Code as Stored Knowledge
This module explores code as a stored knowledge and modern-day literacy. This module will explore this concept by exploring the transition from algorithms to code, which can then be shared across the enterprise. Critical to instant sharing is understanding how the code sharing environment and internet are the tools that will provide intelligence and decision advantage. 
### Lab 1a
GitLab Set up, code store and share
### Homework 1a
Store your own algorithm, Commit, Push, Pull Request Exercise (Due Session 2)

## Session 1b - Fun with Data Structures
The wrong perspective makes easy problems hard, while the right perspective makes hard problems easy. This module introduces the idea that data science is an explore-exploit process to find the right perspective for a particular situation. Critical to this exploration is the art and science of altering data structures until one is found for a situation that can be exploited. This then provides the foundation necessary to applying advance transformations via mathematics of visuals to gain new insights. 

### Lab 1b
Figure out the Reporting Database Data Structure 
### Homework 1b
Reporting Data Structure Exercise (Due Session 2)

## Session 2a - Data Science Process
This module explores data science process 1. Answering the Question, 2. Tidying the Data, 3. Checking the Data, 4. Exploratory Analysis, 5. Using Computational Models with Statistics, Machine Learning and Visuals 6. Reproducibility. It then focuses on Step one with students determining what question they want to explore for their class project.
