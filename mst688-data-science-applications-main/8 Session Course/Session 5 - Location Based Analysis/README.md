# Lab 5 - Location Based Analysis

1. Walk through the Location Based Analysis lab notebook.
2. Understand how to create geopandas dataframes.
3. Understand how to visualize geospatial data.
4. This is just an example exercise and does not need to be turned in.


# Homework 5 - Location Based Analysis

Create a map of your data.  If your data doesn't contain location information, use the dataset from the lab to create a new map.  

1. Use the Jupyter notebook created in your Project-Lastname directory for Homework 2a
 - Create a geopandas dataframe of location based data
 - Create a map to visualize the data
2. Update your analysis plan in the README.md as necessary to explain the geographic visualization you have created
3. Use git to add, commit (include HW5 in commit message), and push your homework to turn it in
