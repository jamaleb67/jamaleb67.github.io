# Lab 6 - Documentation

1. Walk through the documentation lab notebook.
2. Make sure you understand how to use python documentation.
3. Practice creating your own documented code that will return helpful informtion through a docstring.
4. This is just an example exercise and does not need to be turned in.


# Homework 6 - Reproducibility

Do it again!  Find a new dataset and ask a new question.  This could be related to your previous dataset, but make sure it is different. 
This should be much quicker than your first dataset because you can reuse portions of your previous code.

1. Create a new HW6 directory in your MST688-Homework repository and name it HW6
2. Create a new Jupyter Notebook in your HW8 directory and name it HW6-Lastname
 - Import the new dataset
 - Tidy, clean, and explore the data
 - Create some visualizations
 - Ensure the code is well commented
3. Create a README.md describing your question and dataset
4. Use git to add, commit (include HW6 in commit message), and push your homework to turn it in

#### Rubric:
Did the student import a new dataset? (5 points)
Did the student tidy, clean, and explore the data? (5 points)
Did the student create a visualization of the data? (5 points)
Did the student comment their code? (5 points)
