# Lab 1a - Knowing the Infrastructure
### see powerpoint slides for details

1. Set up your gitlab
2. Create a Project
3. Clone project
4. Edit README file
5. Add, commit, push to your repo


# Homework 1a - Storing Knowledge to Share

1. Create a Jupyter Notebook named HW1-Lastname in your MST688-Homework repository
2. Store some bit of knowledge in your notebook
3. Use git to add, commit, and push your knowledge to your repo

## Rubric
Did the student create python function in a jupyter notebook? (5 points)
Did the student store the jupyter notebook in gitlab? (5 points)
Did the student include comments in the code and comments in the git commit message? (5 points)


After completing the Lab and Homework, continue practicing editing your readme file and jupyter notebook.  Add, commit, and push each change to get used to the process.  This is how all homework will be submitted in the class.


# Lab 1b - Fun with Data Structures

1. Explore data from crossref.org by following examples in the Lab1b jupyter notebook
2. Using the crossref.org API, search for authors with your last name.
3. Explore the data returned to understand the data types and structure
4. Convert a portion of the data to a new data structure (e.g. list, dict, dataframe) 
5. This is just an example exercise and does not need to be turned in.


# Homework 1b - World Bank API

Copy the HW1b-Example Jupyter Notebook into your MST688-Homework repository and rename it HW1b-Lastname
Explore the data returned from the World Bank API and add code to accomplish the following tasks (see jupyter notebook for more details).

1. Provide the data structure of the response through three levels of the first item (not the zero item!!) in the list of the LIC object
2. Create two new data structures from LIC. Use python comment syntax ( # or ''') to explain what your are doing
3. Create your own request from World Bank API
4. Manipulate your request into some new data structure
5. Use git to add, commit (include HW1b in commit message), and push your homework to turn it in

#### Rubric:
Did the student provide a summary of the data structure for the first 3 levels? (5 points)
Did the student properly identify the Python data type of each element in the structure? (5 points)
Did the student create two new data structures from the original query? (5 points)
Did the student create a new data structure from a new API request? (5 points)
