# Lab 4 - Statistics and Complexity

1. Walk through the Statistics and Complexity lab notebook.
2. Understand how to generate histograms to visualize distributions and some of the different types of distributions.
3. Understand the different types of computational complexity and how to determine big-O notation.
4. This is just an example exercise and does not need to be turned in.


# Homework 4 - Statistics and Complexity

Run some statistics on your data. Determine the complexity of your algorithms.  

1. Use the Jupyter notebook created in your Project-Lastname directory for Homework 2a
 - Create a histogram of your data and identify (visually) the type of distribution
 - Identify the most computationally expensive algorithm and mark in the comments
2. Update your analysis plan in the README.md as necessary to include any changes you've made to conduct statistical analysis or reduce computational complexity
3. Use git to add, commit (include HW4 in commit message), and push your homework to turn it in
