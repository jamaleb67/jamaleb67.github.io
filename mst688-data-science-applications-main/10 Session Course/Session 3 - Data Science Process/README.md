# Homework 3 - Figuring out your Question

This homework is the first step in creating your final project.  Choose a question related to a topic you want to know more about.  This can be from your work, another course you are taking, your thesis research, or just a personal curiosity.  The question/project can involve classified or unclassified data, however, only do a classified project if you have access to work on it between class sessions.

1. Create a directory in your git repository called Project-Lastname
2. Create a README.md file in your project directory that includes:
 - Initial question
 - Intended type of analysis (e.g. inferential, mechanistic)
 - Describe initial analysis plan
3. Create a jupyter notebook with code of an initial exploration  (question-data symbiotic relationship)
4. Download the Jupyter Notebook and upload it to Blackboard and email to the instructor
