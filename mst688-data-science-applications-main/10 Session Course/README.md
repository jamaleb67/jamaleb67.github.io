## Session 1 - Code as Stored Knowledge
This module explores code as a stored knowledge and modern-day literacy. This module will explore this concept by exploring the transition from algorithms to code, which can then be shared across the enterprise. Critical to instant sharing is understanding how the code sharing environment and internet are the tools that will provide intelligence and decision advantage. 
### Lab 1
GitLab Set up, code store and share
### Homework 1
Store your own algorithm, Commit, Push, Pull Request Exercise (Due Session 2)

## Session 2 - Fun with Data Structures
The wrong perspective makes easy problems hard, while the right perspective makes hard problems easy. This module introduces the idea that data science is an explore-exploit process to find the right perspective for a particular situation. Critical to this exploration is the art and science of altering data structures until one is found for a situation that can be exploited. This then provides the foundation necessary to applying advance transformations via mathematics of visuals to gain new insights.
