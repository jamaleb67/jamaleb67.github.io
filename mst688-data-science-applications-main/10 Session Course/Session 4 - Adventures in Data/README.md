# Lab 4 - Playing with Pandas

1. Open the Lab 4 - Playing with Pandas Jupyter Notebook.
2. Walk through the examples of how to create, use, and modify Pandas DataFrames.
3. For more information, go to go to /mst688-data-science-applications/Basic Python Examples/D1_L5_Pandas/.
4. This is just an example exercise and does not need to be turned in.


# Homework 4 - Tidy the Data

Continue working with the data for your project.  Make your dataset clean and tidy.  

1. Use the Jupyter notebook created in your Project-Lastname directory for Homework 3
 - Organize your data into data stuctures (doesn't have to be dataframes, but describe the data structure used and why)
 - Check data for missing/null values, errors, and inconsistencies.  Correct and describe the correction being made (e.g. setting null values to zero, converting state names to abreviations using lookup table, removing commas from numbers to prevent parsing errors, etc.).  If no errors are found, describe how the data was checked for errors.
2. Update your analysis plan in the README.md to include how you are organizing your data
4. Download the Jupyter Notebook and upload it to Blackboard and email to the instructor
